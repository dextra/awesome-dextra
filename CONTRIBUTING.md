## Contributing

To contribute to this list, and add your own project, you need to follow this guide. First thing is to see if your project meets to following criteria:

 - Repositories must be created or maintained by a Dextra employee by the time the project is submitted.
 - Repositories must be real projects. There are no minimum stars, commit frequency, or things like that, but it must be a real project. 
 - The person must have created, or be a member of the Repository.

Examples of real projects in our vision

 - Published packages/libraries/frameworks (Published meaning people can use this on their own project, using the available publishing method for the platform it is built on)
 - Open Source apps
 - Original proof of concepts projects, that is used on tutorials/articles

Examples of projects not considered reals in out vision

 - Simple proof of concept projects, or test repositories
 - Personal projects that has little or no use for the community, like personal portfolios, etc
 - Repositories used for personal studies or even forked repositories from online courses

To sum up, a project which has relevance to other people in the community.

If your project meets those criterias, then is time to fork this repository and [send us an pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

The changes on README.md must follow the following guide line to be accepted.

The project must be under a category, and if a category still don't exist, it can be created (be sure to add this new category to the index on the start of the file and add an awesome icon to it! [This](https://simpleicons.org) could help)

The new added line on the category must follow as show bellow:

```
 - [Project name](project link) - A short project description. ROLE_TYPE: [Person name](Person github profile link)
```

`ROLE_TYPE` can be one of:
 - `Author`: when the person is the original author of that project
 - `Maintainer`: when the person is part of the team of the project and has contributions on it.

Entries, both categories and the entry list must be in alphabetical order.
